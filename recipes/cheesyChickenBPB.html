    <h2>How To Make Lasagna Step-By-Step</h2>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>Fill a large pot with lightly salted water and bring to a rolling boil. Stir in penne and return to a boil. Cook pasta uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender yet firm to the bite, about 10 minutes.</li>
        <li>Meanwhile, cook bacon in a large skillet over medium-high heat, turning occasionally, until fat has rendered, 4 to 5 minutes. Remove bacon to a plate to cool.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Add chicken to the same skillet; stir in Italian seasoning and black pepper. Cook and stir until chicken is golden, about 5 minutes; remove from heat. Chop bacon and add to the skillet.</li>
        <li>Melt butter In a large saucepan over medium heat. Whisk in flour until smooth and golden. Pour in milk, whisking constantly. Stir in mozzarella cheese and Gruyere cheese; cook until cheese is melted.</li>
        <li>Drain pasta. Pour cheese sauce over pasta; stir in chicken and bacon. Pour mixture into a casserole dish.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven, uncovered, until bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
